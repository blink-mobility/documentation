# 02_BlinkMobility

## Problem description:
People with impairments <br/>
-> reduced mobility access <br/>
-> no easy access for public transport<br/>
-> need 3 days in advance to book for alternative ride services <br/>

## Proposed solution:

Mobility service for impaired people  <br/>
-> connect with volunteering car drivers <br/>
-> connect with available resources (specific cars in institutions...) <br/>
-> create user friendly web application specifically designed to this purpose <br/>

## Outcome:
-> solve a real need! <br/>
-> creation of a social community <br/>

Room for inclusion, solidarity and sustainable mobility for all!
